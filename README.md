This is the client-side app that interfaces with the where-is-waldo-api

Live version: https://hbar1st.github.io/where-is-waldo/

Note: this game works on Chrome but not Firefox due to the use of anchors.

Nice to have feature for the future:
- a way to pause and restart game play (would require the api allow that). The pause would blur the scene again.
